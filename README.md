This is a project that utilizes Pandas & Matplotlib to analyze & visualize football stats of all players in the English Premier League.
Data is first scraped from https://understat.com/league/EPL and then the program prompts the user to select which attributes (goals, assists, etc) the user wants to compare for which players.
A bar graph is then displayed to visualize the appropriate stats.
