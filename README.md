This is a python repositary that utilizes Pandas, Matplotlib and CSV files to analyze football stats.
There are two programs in this repositaries:
1. compare stats: this program fetches premier league players' data and stats from [understat.com](https://understat.com/league/EPL) and allows users to compare players
2. isl teams analysis: this program fetches data from a csv file that contains isl teams' standings and stats and performs some analysis using Pandas. I developed this program only to practice pandas
